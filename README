guile-gsl
=========

Author: Jason R. Green

Guile-GSL is an implementation of Guile bindings and wrappers for the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL). Guile is the GNU extension language and Scheme
interpreter. The GSL is a free numerical library licensed under the GNU GPL.

**Currently, there are only GSL matrix and GSL vector types that can be zeroed,
set, and printed.**

Installation
------------
Assumes working versions of GSL and Guile are installed in standard location.

To install in guile-gsl/
$ make
and generate the executable guile_gsl.

To run
$ ./guile_gsl

Comments
--------

In GSL, double precision numbers are the default. If a type other than double
is involved, function names are modified by a type-related modifier, after the
initial module prefix. In some of the current Guile-GSL functions doubles are
assumed. GSL vector and matrix elements are initially zeroed with
gsl_foo_calloc.

Wrappers
--------

(e.g., zero_gsl_foo, set_gsl_foo )
Wrappers have the form

1. Check input, smob are of suitable types
2. Retrieve immediate word of smob
3. Perform GSL operation
4. Invoke the update function
